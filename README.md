This project is the product landing page for Free Code Camp's responsive web design course. This is my fictional webdesign "Bminus Design" I tried to stay with a sad classroom theme with the teacher and the dark gray and blue color scheme. Because one may be sad after studying so hard for a test, only to get a B minus. I studied the sample website provided by free code camp, so there may be some elements, such as the media queries, that are very functionally similar. I may add to this project in the future.
